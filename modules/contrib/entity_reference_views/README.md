Introduction
-------------
This module adds a new widget that builds off of the entity reference autocomplete widget. The design is intended to include a display of a view in the form display.

### Example
- Create a new view of the type `entity_reference_field_attachment` based on the target entity type
- Make this view display a table
- Populate table with fields to display
- Navigate to configure an entity
- Add an entity reference field that uses the widget: `Autocomplete (Views)`
- Navigate to the `Manage form display` tab
- Open the settings for the Autocomplete (Views) field
- The `View` dropdown will have options for all pertinent views
- Select the desired view
- The selected view will now display on the entity form underneath the autocomplete widget
